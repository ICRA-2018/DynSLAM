    "# DynSLAM: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping in Dynamic Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a dense SLAM system written in C++. It builds on [InfiniTAM](https://github.com/victorprad/InfiniTAM), adding support\n",
    "for stereo input, outdoor operation, voxel garbage collection,\n",
    "and separate dynamic object (e.g., car) reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developed as part of my Master's Thesis, in the [Computer\n",
    "Vision and Geometry Group](https://cvg.ethz.ch) of [ETH\n",
    "Zurich](https://ethz.ch). Accepted to ICRA 2018 accompanying\n",
    "the paper \"Robust Dense Mapping for Large-Scale Dynamic \n",
    "Environments\" by Andrei BÃ¢rsan, Peidong Liu, Marc Pollefeys, and Andreas Geiger.\n",

    "## Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "The following screenshot shows an early preview of DynSLAM in action. It\n",
    "takes in stereo input, computes the depth map, using either ELAS or\n",
    "dispnet, segments the input RGB using Multi-task Network Cascades to\n",
    "detect object instances, and then separately reconstructs the static\n",
    "background and individual object instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top pane shows the dense reconstruction of the background. The\n",
    "following panes show, in top-down, left-right order: the left RGB frame,\n",
    "the computed depth map, the output of the instance-aware semantic\n",
    "segmentation algorithm, the input RGB to the instance reconstructor,\n",
    "memory usage statistics, and a novel view of the reconstructed object\n",
    "instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The colors in the 3D reconstructions correspond to the voxel weights:\n",
    "red-tinted areas are low-weight ones, whereas blue ones are high-weight\n",
    "ones. Areas which remain low-weight even several frames after first\n",
    "being observed are very likely to be noisy, while blue ones are ones\n",
    "where the system is confident in its reconstruction.\n",

    " * [My InfiniTAM fork](https://github.com/AndreiBarsan/InfiniTAM), which\n",
    "   is used by this system for the actual 3D reconstruction (via\n",
    "   volumetric fusion, using voxel hashing for map storage). My fork\n",
    "   contains a series of small tweaks designe to make InfiniTAM a little\n",
    "   easier to use as a component of a larger system.\n",
    " * [My fork of the official implemntation of Multi-task Network Cascades](https://github.com/AndreiBarsan/MNC)\n",
    "    for image semantic segmentation. We need this for identifying where\n",
    "    the cars are in the input videos. Using semantics enables us to\n",
    "    detect both moving and static cars.\n",
    " * [My fork of the modified Caffe used by MNC](https://github.com/AndreiBarsan/caffe-mnc). Since MNC's architecture requires\n",
    " some tweaks to Caffe's internals, its authors forked Caffe and modified\n",
    " it to their needs. I forked their fork and made it work with my tools,\n",
    " while also making it faster by merging it with the Caffe master, which\n",
    " enabled cuDNN 5 support, among many other things.\n",
    "  * [My mirror of libelas](https://github.com/AndreiBarsan/libelas-tooling)\n",
    "  which I use for pre-computing the depth maps. I'm working on getting\n",
    "  the depth computation to happen on the fly, and investigating other\n",
    "  methods for estimating depth from stereo.\n",

    "## Regenerating Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots in the corresponding ICRA paper can all be regenerated from the raw\n",
    "data included in this repository as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Unzip `./raw-data-archives/raw-logz.7z` to `./csv`.\n",
    "  1. Install the data analysis dependencies (e.g., in a Python virtual\n",
    "     environment or using Anaconda). Installing the pacakges using the Anaconda\n",
    "     option can be done as:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     conda install --yes jupyter pandas numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "  1. Start Jupyter:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     cd notebooks && jupyter notebook\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "  1. Regenerate Figure 6 using `./notebooks/StaticAndDynamicDepthAnalysis.ipynb`\n",
    "  1. Regenerate Figure 7 using `./notebooks/Voxel GC Stats.ipynb`\n",

    "## Building and Running DynSLAM\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to check out the system very quickly, you're in luck!\n",
    "There's a pre-preprocessed sequence you can download to see how it works (see \n",
    "the \"Demo Sequence\" section).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to preprocess your own sequences, see the \"Preprocessing\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is built using CMake, and it depends on several submodules. \n",
    "As such, make sure you don't forget the `--recursive` flag when cloning the \n",
    "repository. If you did\n",
    "forget it, just run `git submodule update --init --recursive`.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Clone the repository if you haven't already:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git clone --recursive https://github.com/AndreiBarsan/DynSLAM\n",
    "    ```\n",
    " 1. Install OpenCV 2.4.9 and CUDA 8.\n",
    " 1. [Install docker and nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker).\n",
    "    They are a requirement for preprocessing the data so that it can be consumed\n",
    "    by DynSLAM.\n",
    " 1. Install the prerequisites (Ubuntu example):\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    sudo apt-get install libxmu-dev libxi-dev freeglut3 freeglut3-dev glew-utils libglew-dev libglew-dbg libpthread-stubs0-dev binutils-dev libgflags-dev libpng++-dev libeigen3-dev\n",
    "    ```\n",
    " 1. Build Pangolin to make sure it gets put into the CMake registry:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    cd src/Pangolin && mkdir build/ && cd $_ && cmake ../ && make -j$(nproc)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    " 1. Build the project in the standard CMake fashion:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j$(nproc)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Building DynSLAM Inside Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "While the preprocessing makes heavy use of `nvidia-docker` in order to simplify\n",
    "the process, and does so very effectively, running the main DynSLAM program \n",
    "inside Docker is still not supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Dockerfile` in the root of this project *can* be used to build DynSLAM \n",
    "inside a Docker container, but, due to its OpenGL GUI, it cannot run inside it\n",
    "(as of February 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutions to this problem include using one of the newly released CUDA+OpenGL \n",
    "Docker images from NVIDIA as a base image, or fully supporting CLI-only \n",
    "operation. Both of these tasks remain part of future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demo Sequence\n",
    " 1. After building the project, try processing the demo sequence: \n",
    "    [here is a short sample from KITTI Odometry Sequence 06](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~iab/dynslam/mini-kitti-odometry-seq-06-for-dynslam.7z).\n",
    "      1. Extract that to a directory, and run DynSLAM on it (the mkdir circumvents a silly bug):\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        mkdir -p csv/ && build/DynSLAM --use_dispnet --dataset_root=path/to/extracted/archive --dataset_type=kitti-odometry\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### KITTI Tracking and Odometry Sequences\n",
    " 1. The system can run on any KITTI Odometry and Tracking sequence. \n",
    "    KITTI Raw sequences should also work, but have not been \n",
    "    tested since the evaluation is trickier, as their LIDAR data is not cleaned\n",
    "    up to account for the rolling shutter effect. In order to run the system on\n",
    "    these sequences, the instance-aware semantic segmentations and dense depth\n",
    "    maps must be preprocessed, since DynSLAM does not yet support computing them\n",
